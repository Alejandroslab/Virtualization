this has been done for openwrt.

openwrt only provides a raw image (.img) 

in order to use in vmware esxi we need to convert it to vdmk

we can use this:


qemu-img convert -f raw -O vmdk ~/Downloads/openwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.img openwrt-15.05-x86-64-combined-ext4.vmdk

after converting go to vmware esxi and create a brand new vm 

just leave everything as default

turn off the vm as we basically need to replace the vdmk with our vdmk that we have converted.

To do that go to the datastore where is placed the vdmk that has been created along with the vm creation

delete it then after renaming the vmdk that has been converted (with the same name) just upload it 

finally you will need to change the hard disk type from SCSI 0:0 to IDE 0

done!

this trick could work for any .img you have!
