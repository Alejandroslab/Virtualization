When you migrate a machine you need to be careful about the adapter settings as this may not be workign properly

shutdown your vm go to settings > Network Adapter > Adapter Type
and choose one adapter. I chose 'E1000' and it worked

Then if you have VLAN setted up you have to check that your virtual swithc is connected to the VLAN ID you need otherwise there will be no internet

finally you may want also to have more displayed settings like the hostname and IP in your dashboard

therefore remember to connect a virtual CD/DVD drive as it is needed for VM tools
