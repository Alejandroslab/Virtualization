When we have some new 10gbps nic we want to try it out

you can do that using iperf3 
this is available both for linux (sudo apt install iperf3) and both for windows

For windows just download the .exe and then open cmd and move to the folder where the .exe is located 
(use cd and 'dir' command to list the files (not 'ls' as it is not linux))

Now commands are easy:

in linux or cmd alternatively run in the listening machine:

iperf3 -s 

it will appear 'Server listening on 5201' 

this means that this machine is listening 

Now, to run the test use the other machine and run:

iperf3 -c 192.168.1.1

where 192.168.1.1 is the IP of your listening machine

now iperf3 will run some times the transfer speed test 

after finishing you will see the trasnfer speed!
