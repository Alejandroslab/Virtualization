this may happen when you transfer a vm image from QEMU to vmware esxi

if you have installed RedHat VirtIO drivers and afterwards in VmWare you install the vmware tools then you will have that the ethernet connection will disconnect whenever you lock your pc


this will cause an issue whenever you will try to access via rdp as you need to first wake the pc 


to solve this just uninstall all RedHat VirtIO drivers as you will no longer need that 
then everything should work again

you can RDP without issues

REMEMBER! you may need to uninstal and reinstall also vmware tools

FINALLY JUST USE THE 'E1000' ADAPTER AND NOT THE 'VMXNET3'!
