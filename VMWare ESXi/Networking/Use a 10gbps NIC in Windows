In windows 10 you can leave the virtual NIC to 'E1000'

VMXNET3 adapter seem to be not recognized in Windows 10 if you do not install the vmware tools

In windows 11 and windows 10 if you install vmware tools the adapter VMXNET3 will be recognised
although transfer speed tests with 'iperf3' will get the same results of the adapter 'E1000' (like 2-3 gbps and not 10 gbps)
If you install vmware tools in windows 10 you may get the same results just a little improve to 3-4gbps .
This result has been reached with a windows machine installed on ssd so hard disk speed does not make too much difference

If you use 2 linux machines (ubuntu, ubuntu based distros, rhel based distros, you get 9-10gbps of transfer speed with 'iperf3' )

therefore:

between 2 windows machines speed never exceeds 2 gbps 

from a windows machine to a linux machine speed reach 4gbps.

between 2 linux machines speed reaches 10gbps. 

remember! adapters of your machnes must be 10gbps ! 


Formally in control panel you will get a maximum speed of 1gbps and not 10gbps but this is just a formality
as if you use 'iperf3' to inspect speed you will see that the NIC will perform up to 1gbps till 10gbps
