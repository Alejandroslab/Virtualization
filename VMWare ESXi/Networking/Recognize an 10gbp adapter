if you want 10gbps connection you cannot select the virutal E1000 adapter (that is the simulation of an old 1gbps adapter) 
For Linux you must select the VMXNET3 adapter 

for windows you must select E1000 and it will work as 10gbps even if formally it will be written 1gbps.
to use VMXNET3 also in Windows you need to install the vmware tools.

to check inside your vm 

sudo ethtool eth0 -i 

and check the '10000Mbps' under speed
