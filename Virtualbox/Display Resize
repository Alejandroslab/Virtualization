To resize the display accordingly to your monitor you must install the Guest Additions
Just insert the virtual cd and install it (for Windows 11 it is sufficient VBWindowsAdditions as for Windows 10)

After that reboot as required
At the start you will be sure that guest additions have been installed by the mouse integration

You may not see the automatically resize of the screen
To do that you must check your Display settings:

You have to set at least 128 mb to the video card !

Otherwise it will not work

Then go to your guest os (I tried in Windows) go to Display Settings
and set the right resolution!

(You do not need to change the video card. You can leave VBoxVGA
You do not even need to enable 3d acceleration)
