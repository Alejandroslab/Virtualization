Sometimes when you need to import a vm from Qnap Virtualization station you may need to adjust the vm settings correctly
This is true if you have a server version like centos

From QNAP Virtualization Station you know that sometimes Virtio drivers are used

Therefore some system may not boot

In order to be able to boot them just go to settings, go to Storage, select 'Controller: SCSI' and set the type as 'virtio-scsi'

This will allow you to boot the system
