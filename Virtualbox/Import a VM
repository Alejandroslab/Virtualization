You can import a VM with 2 ways:

If you have the .ovf file:

Just select Import VM and select your .ovf file
You will also need the vdmk file with the .ovf one. The vdmk is like the virtual hard drive in which is installed
The .ovf will simply recall the virtual pc specs

The other way is if you have the .vbox and the .vdmk without the .ovf file. (or the .vmx and the .vdmk)
This will happen when you copy the vm folder inside the folder in which virtualbox stores them
This has usually this path:

C:\\Users\MyUser\VirtualBoxVMS

or something like that

Now remember that the .vbox file is only a config file like an .xml that you can also open with notepad

You will see there the amount of RAM, CPU etc

To import this VM then you should create a New machine. Select the OS click next
then when it asks for the hard drive click one:
'Use an existing virtual disk'

The select your hard drive (with extension .vdmk or .vdi (.vdi is the same of .vdmk but vdi is more VirtualBox specific))
and run your vm
DONE!

REMEMBER!You can also import a .vdmk file that is stored on an external hd or even a network folder
In this case anyways VirtualBox will not create a copy inside the VM folder as in the 'Import appliance' with the .ovf file case
(located in C:\\Users\MyUser\VirtualBoxVMS\..) but will simply connect to that .vmdk, .vdi
