if you want to access your local resources you will notice

that your IP is differnt than the others one of the network

this because your network adapter is set up as NAT

In order to have access you have to go to
virtualbox preferences then select
'Devices'->'Network'Â´->'Network Settings'

on 'Attached to' select 'Bridged Adapter'
and the name of the adapter that can be the same that you use in your host.

reboot (eventually your VM) and you are done!
you will now have the same ip range of the other devices of your network
