How to install VMWare tools if the option is grayed out

1. Shut down the virtual machine.

2. Open VMWare Workstation Player and right-click on the VM. (Don't start the VM)

3. Select the "Settings" option to edit the hardware settings.

4. Highlight the CD/Drive on the left side-bar under the Hardware tab and click on the remove button.

5. Repeat the above step to remove the Floppy Drive. (Optional, but this is what fixed it for me. Courtesy: AskUbuntu forums)

6. Click on the "Add button" and select "CD/DVD" Drive and select finish.
The right pane should have now have the option "Use Physical Drive > Auto Detect" enabled.

click ok done!
